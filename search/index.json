[{"content":"Hello! This is kind of my first post, and well\u0026hellip; welcome!\nI\u0026rsquo;m Isatis, and the blog is called Ninefold Notions, primarily due to the character I have being an anthropomorphic nine-tailed fox (kitsune), but it also is a blog around security, society, philosophy, stuff I\u0026rsquo;m learning or nerding about, and so on. It\u0026rsquo;ll also be sort of a progress meter for things I\u0026rsquo;m working on, e.g. things I\u0026rsquo;m making and things I\u0026rsquo;m breaking.\nFeel free to check out the \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; section for more info!\n","date":"2025-01-21T00:00:00-07:00","permalink":"https://www.isatis.blue/p/yip/","title":"Yip!"}]
