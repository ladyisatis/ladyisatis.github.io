Hello! This is kind of my first post, and well... welcome!

I'm Isatis, and the blog is called Ninefold Notions, primarily due to the character I have being an anthropomorphic nine-tailed fox (kitsune), but it also is a blog around security, society, philosophy, stuff I'm learning or nerding about, and so on. It'll also be sort of a progress meter for things I'm working on, e.g. things I'm making and things I'm breaking.

Feel free to check out the "About" section for more info!
